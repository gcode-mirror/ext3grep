ext3grep-0.6.0

	Don't completely and silently break if any file has a single quote in it's name.
	Don't exhaust the 32-bit address space with mmaps, by mmapping at most 256 inode tables on x86.
	Added support for recovering files larger than 2 GB.

ext3grep-0.5.0

	Set the correct modification time on files.
	Add extended directory blocks in the order parent -> child, so that it does not happen
	  anymore that some extended directory blocks couldn't be added because their parent
	  directory wasn't added yet.
        Force recompile if CXXFLAGS changes.
	Don't print any non-ASCII characters.
	Treat any non-ASCII character as 'weird' in filenames, thus also values larger than 127.
	Use unsigned long for bitmap_t instead of uint64_t.
	Added README.globals with a description of the used global variables.
	Added README.actions with a description of the used action functions.
	Allow locate database include files without first listing the parent directory.
	Handle orphaned inodes correctly.
	Fixed the reported segfault with backtrace:
	  #0  0x0000000000419084 in Inode::dtime (this=0x0) at ./ext3.h:118
	  #1  0x000000000041168b in filter_dir_entry (...
	Do not include asm/byteorder.h anymore, which appears to be a private header.

ext3grep-0.4.1

	Fix compile problem with EXTERNAL_BLOCK=0

ext3grep-0.4.0

	Address the problem where two dir entries have the same name but different inode numbers.
	Print version as first output line.
	Print more human readable errors if opening of device fails.
	If configure with libcwd, add --debug and --debug-malloc commandline options.
	Asserts now print a backtrace.
	Use EXT3_ROOT_INO instead of 2.
	Make --enable-debug the default.
        Demand --enable-maintainer-mode to be used with svn.
	Append '# END' to the end of the stage1/2 files, and test for it when reading it;
	  regenerate the cache file if it doesn't end on '# END'.

ext3grep-0.3.1

        Accept weird characters in filenames (almost always).
	Added code to warn about rejected filenames because of it's characters
	  (although that is hardly used now we that accept everything).
	Added code that collects statistics about the number
	  of weird characters in a directory (not used yet).

ext3grep-0.3.0

	Added support for filesystems without the incompatibility feature EXT3_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_FILETYPE.
	Removed assertion `inode_to_count.size() == 1'. The new algorithm uses
	  the inode found in the journal in this case now (code that I added to 0.1.0).
	Improved some error messages.

ext3grep-0.2.0

	Output error message if device can't be opened.
	Fixed a MAJOR bug for 32-bit systems.

ext3grep-0.1.1

	Added largefile support; 64-bit off_t.

ext3grep-0.1.0

	Now using journal to find inode numbers of extended directory blocks!
	Added detection of reused or corrupted indirect blocks, aborting iteration.
	Now using mmap(2) for the inode tables, use --disable-mmap to disable.
	PCH dependency problem was fixed.
	Write output to directory "RESTORED_FILES" instead of to ".".
	Fixed a bug that prevented the recovery of files in the root.
	Fixed infinite loop when --journal-transaction is out of range.

ext3grep-0.0.4

	Commandline option --histogram: Fixed initialization of commandline_before
	  when --before is not given and time_t is signed.
	Use new struct Inode instead of ext3_inode. Use inode directly from
	what was read from disk without copying them first (sizeof(Inode) is
	equal to the real inode size on disk, so this is possible). Use
	accessors for every access to an inode.

ext3grep-0.0.3

	Using e2progs headers instead of kernel headers.
	Print inode when assert(first_block) fails.
	Changed license from GPL3 to GPL2.
	Commandline option --version: Print correct version of ext3grep .
	Commandline option --zeroed-inodes: Does not need parameter.
	Fixed compiler warning on 32-bit.
	Use i_reserved2 instead of i_reserved1 to store inode number (for debugging purposes only, see HOWTO).
	EXT3_ORPHAN_FS is only used in kernel memory, remove code to print it.

ext3grep-0.0.2

	Added a temporary workaround to compile with linux headers 2.6.24.

ext3grep-0.0.1

	Clean up of build system.

ext3grep-0.0.0

	First public release.
