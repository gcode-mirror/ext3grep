ext3grep-0.0.5

	Added a configure option --enable-mmap to use mmap(2) for the inode tables.
	PCH dependency problem was fixed.
	Write output to directory "RESTORED_FILES" instead of to ".".
	Fixed a bug that prevented the recovery of files in the root.
	Fixed infinite loop when --journal-transaction is out of range.

ext3grep-0.0.4

	Commandline option --histogram: Fixed initialization of commandline_before
	  when --before is not given and time_t is signed.
	Use new struct Inode instead of ext3_inode. Use inode directly from
	what was read from disk without copying them first (sizeof(Inode) is
	equal to the real inode size on disk, so this is possible). Use
	accessors for every access to an inode.

ext3grep-0.0.3

	Using e2progs headers instead of kernel headers.
	Print inode when assert(first_block) fails.
	Changed license from GPL3 to GPL2.
	Commandline option --version: Print correct version of ext3grep .
	Commandline option --zeroed-inodes: Does not need parameter.
	Fixed compiler warning on 32-bit.
	Use i_reserved2 instead of i_reserved1 to store inode number (for debugging purposes only, see HOWTO).
	EXT3_ORPHAN_FS is only used in kernel memory, remove code to print it.

ext3grep-0.0.2

	Added a temporary workaround to compile with linux headers 2.6.24.

ext3grep-0.0.1

	Clean up of build system.

ext3grep-0.0.0
