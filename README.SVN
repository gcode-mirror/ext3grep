Getting source from SVN
-----------------------

See http://code.google.com/p/ext3grep/source/checkout

Initial Initialisation
----------------------

If you checked out this directory with svn, then you will need to execute:

./autogen.sh

You only need to do this once.

After that please read INSTALL.
